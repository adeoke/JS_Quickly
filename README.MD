# JavaScript Stuff

I needed to learn Javascript quickly, and be competent enough to build server side applications.
This is the beginning of that process. 

Note that this is really, really quick so my usual formatting and organisation will be ignored.

Components included (once completed):

##Node
##Mongoose/MongoDB
##Express
##Fetch
##OAuth2
##JWT

That should be it.
